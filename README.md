# ExpenseManager
In todays world everyone has a habit of overspending money and regretting it later. I often see that people calculate
how much they spent in 15 days and then they often get worried by overspending. Expense Manager will help the user to
control the expenses they make in everyday life


This is a java based application which is used to manage expenses of a user.
In this application a user can store their expenses with a ID choosen by them and retreive their expenses whenever 
they wish to do so. This app will also have a feature to set up a limit on the amount of money spent in a month. The app
will alarm the user when the user has crossed the specific amount

This is intended for everyone who wish to manage their expenses and 
control on their spending habits. As a university student, I can understand how hard it can be to manage everyday 
expenses in day to day life, thereby by this app I want to help everyone especially university students to manage their 
everyday expenses
